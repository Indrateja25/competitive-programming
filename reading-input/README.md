# Reading Input

Reading input can be tricky sometimes. Sometimes I spend way too much time only to get everything from the input.

This directory contains some input reading approaches that might help in the next problem!

* Number of test cases
* Stop when both integers are 0
* Returns the number of items read
* Read variable number of inputs
