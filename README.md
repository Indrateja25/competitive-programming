## Code

Preferably my solutions are written in C++. Whenever I find myself unable to solve
some problem in plain C++, I switch to Java.

## ICPC Veredicts

| Code   | Description                        |
| ------ | :---------------------------------:|
| AC     | Accepted                           |
| PE     | Presentation Error                 |
| WA     | Wrong Answer                       |
| TLE    | Time Limit Exceeded                |
| MLE    | Memory Limit Exceeded              |
| RTE    | Run Time Error                     |

## Testing

For UVa problems, `freopen` can often not be used. But to make testing easier:

Run passing your inpur and output streams:

`$ ./a.out input myoutput`

Compare:

`$ diff myoutput input`

## Problems from other Online Judges

This repo also contains (or may contain) a few problems from other Online Judges, like SPOJ and ACM/ICPC.
